Woah, this opportunity sounds way too good. But I'm a broke student and I've always wanted to be a pro basketball player...

:: Cooking Time! {"position":"1900,500","size":"100,100"}
As an amateur chef, you kind of know your way around the kitchen. You microwave the hashbrowns and start cooking the bacon on a pan. You get to the sausage and whip out a knife to start chopping them in thinner slices.

However, your knife skills aren't that great, and you accidentally cut one of your fingers! It doesn't bleed that much, but you feel dumb about yourself.

[[Ask Reddit how to use a knife->Open Reddit]]

[[Continue cooking]]

You sit in court in your orange jumper suit, with your hands and legs shackled.

(text-style:"smear")["Guilty. 2 counts of endangerment and reckless driving. 2 counts of third-degree murder. 1 count of evading police."]

After minutes of waiting, you give up and just drive back home, thinking that the Reddit post is just some dumb scam post.

You make it back home to your cozy place and make yourself some dinner before surfing the web again.

Your life of chasing your dreams fell back to reality to the same o' way it has been.

Damn.

:: Drive through the spikes {"position":"800,1700","size":"100,100"}
You couldn't react in time and drive straight through the spikes. You look at your dashboard and see that one of the tires got punctured. However, your car is still able to drive off quite well.

You continue speeding down the freeway and see some more cops up ahead. Remembering your basketball skills, you evade some of the blockade by doing evasive maneuvers around them.

''10 minutes have passed.''

They're still up your rear. You exit the freeway and onto local streets. You approach an intersection with a red light, but adrenaline overtook you.

"Fuck it, I'm driving through."

What are you doing???

You decided to make a run for it from the police out of pure panic. You start speeding up dramatically and drive erratically, not knowing where you are trying to drive anymore.

(text-style:"buoy")[Your only goal is to drive away].

As the pursuit continues, more police cars join in on the chase. You enter the freeway, only to realize that up ahead, some cops have set up a spike-strip to pop your tires.

[[Drive through the spikes]]
[[Make a sharp turn to avoid the spikes]]


:: Make a sharp turn to avoid the spikes {"position":"1000,1700","size":"100,100"}
You turn sharply to avoid the spikes. Congrats! You successfully avoided any of the spikes from hitting your tires.

However, to do that, you ended up vearing off into the cement wall. Your car slams with tremendous force, and you die instantly on impact without realizing it.

You walk out the door and stand next the police officer. He gives you commands in regards of doing a sobriety test. The cop begins off with a simple eye tracking test and you pass with flying colors. Then he tells you to walk in a straight line. As you start walking, you and the cop hear a comotion occuring at a motel nearby.

Little did you or the cop know that what was occuring nearby is a motel shootout between two rival drug cartels. You end up getting caught by a stray bullet.

Emptiness.

Thoughts and confusing start racing through your mind.
//Am I at the right park?
Is this Reddit post a prank?
Where is everybody?//

As you start walking back to your car, you see a white van pull up. Unbeknownst, you thought it was probably the coache's van.

:: Wait a distance at the park {"position":"1600,2100","size":"100,100"}
Being cautious, you wait the park, but you just couldn't help but stare at the van and the people coming out. They wave at you in a friendly manner, but you still feel a bit intimidated and stay put.

Little did you know that they were distracting you from another van that approached behind you. You get sacked and something pokes you on your left arm.

You two start exchanging a short conversation about basketball.

"I think LeBron James is the GOAT. Far better than Michael Jor-"

Before you could finish your sentence, you felt a sharp stab in your left arm. You black out.
