Woah, this opportunity sounds way too good. But I'm a broke student and I've always wanted to be a pro basketball player...

:: Cooking Time! {"position":"1900,500","size":"100,100"}
As an amateur chef, you kind of know your way around the kitchen. You microwave the hashbrowns and start cooking the bacon on a pan. You get to the sausage and whip out a knife to start chopping them in thinner slices.

However, your knife skills aren't that great, and you accidentally cut one of your fingers! It doesn't bleed that much, but you feel dumb about yourself.

Arise! You get up from bed to get the day started.

However, a (text-style:"smear","blink")[motel shootout] occured nearby between two rival drug cartels. You end up getting caught by a stray bullet.

Out of pure intrusiveness, you take a picture of your brown masterpiece and send it to the server.

The entire server immediate reacts with fear and horror.
(text-style:"rumble")[''"??????"
"WHAT THE FUCK ADRIAN???"
"bro why did u send that"'']

You laugh hysterically while still on the toilet. However, another notification pops up immediately after:
(text-colour:grey)[You have been banned from the server.]
Devastated, you clean and wipe your butt with regret.
